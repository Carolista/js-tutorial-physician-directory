PLANNING NOTES

Here are a few examples of how to write notes to plan ahead for different parts of your program. 

1. IMPORTS
	- Need readline-sync module for getting user input
    - Need fs module for reading JSON file

2. DATA I HAVE, DATA I NEED
	- Doctors' names and numbers are in a local JSON file which needs to be read and converted to an array of JS objects
	- Need to ask user for their choice of search types and correlate that to the search functions
	- If searching by name, will need a string (no numbers or spaces)
	- If searching by first letter of last name...
	- If searching by area code...
	- When pulling matching records for user...
	- When printing results...
	- Will need to ask user if they want to do another search...

3. SMALL FUNCTIONS
	- Create array of JS objects from JSON file 
	- Get search type from user
	- Search by name
	- Search by first letter of last name
	- Search by area code
    - Sort by last name
	- Print formatted results to console

4. MAIN FUNCTION
	- transform doctors data
	- print some sort of intro message
	- loop until user is done:
		- get search type & validate
        - get info from user to perform search
        - run search
        - print results
        - ask if they want to do another search
	- print some kind of exit message
